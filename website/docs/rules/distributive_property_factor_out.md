The `Distributive Property` of numbers says that we can factor out common values from terms connected with an addition operator.

This rule is expressed by the equation `ab + ac = a(b + c)`

!!! note

        This is a core transformation used in combining like terms, though we usually skip over it mentally because humans are pretty intelligent.

        Consider that the `9y + 9y` example from above becomes `(9 + 9) * y`. If you apply a constant simplification rule, you end up with `18y`, which results from combining the two like `y` terms.

### Transformations

Given a common parent node, this rule extracts the common value from both sides, leaving an addition and a multiplication.

#### Addition

`ab + ac = a(b + c)`

```
          +               *
         / \             / \
        /   \           /   \
       /     \    ->   /     \
      *       *       a       +
     / \     / \             / \
    a   b   a   c           b   c
```
