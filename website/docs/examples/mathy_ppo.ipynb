    "Rather than invest engineering time into writing heuristics, we can use machine learning algorithms to train a model that can select which actions to take in order to find an optimal path to a solution. Not only is this more robust than random action selections, but it will make solving many types of problems trivial once we get going.\n",

    "1. Each \"Environment\" is constructed to generate math problem texts, and determine if an expression is \"solved\"\n",

    "The test function evaluates the performance of our trained PPO agent. It loads the agent's model from a saved checkpoint and runs it through multiple episodes in different environments. In each episode, the agent makes decisions based on its learned policy, and we track the rewards it earns. The main goal is to see how well the agent performs in these test scenarios, indicated by the total rewards it accumulates across episodes. This testing phase is crucial as it gives us a clear picture of the effectiveness of our training and the agent's ability to handle various challenges within the environments. The average reward per episode, calculated at the end, serves as a key metric to assess the agent's performance."
