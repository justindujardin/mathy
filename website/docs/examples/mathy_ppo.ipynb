    "Before we get started, let's review what mathy envs are and how they work. Mathy envs are reinforcement learning environments for maniuplating math trees with a rules system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each mathy_envs environment generates math problem texts and determines if the current expression is \"solved\" or not\n",
    "2. Users/Models interact with the environments by playing \"episodes\" where they solve problems given a set of rules and environment-specific logic\n",
    "3. Depending on the context the outputs are either used as inputs to a training model, or as an output demonstration for an end-user\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use reinforcement learning to train a model that is capable of solving problems generated by the mathy_envs library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we choose the `PolySimplify` environment which generates controllably difficult polynomial simplification problems, and implements logic to determine when they're solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the machine learning portion, we choose the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which is an online learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the machine learning parts, let's quickly get a taste for the basics of our environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathy envs implements a base environment interface, and that's wrapped in a set of classes exposed for gym/gymnasium libraries."

    "The test function evaluates the performance of our trained PPO agent. It loads the agent's model from a saved checkpoint and runs it through multiple episodes in different environments. In each episode, the agent makes decisions based on its learned policy, and we track the rewards it earns. The main goal is to see how well the agent performs in these test scenarios, indicated by the total rewards it accumulates across episodes. This testing phase is crucial as it gives us a clear picture of the effectiveness of our training and the agent's ability to handle various challenges within the environments. The average reward per episode, calculated at the end, serves as a key metric to assess the agent's performance."
