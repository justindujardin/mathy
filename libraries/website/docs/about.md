Mathy was born out of a desire to have a free tool for working through algebra problems. Much research has informed the design of Mathy's computer algebra system, tree rendering, and learning environments.

## Research

### [Tidier Trees](https://reingold.co/tidier-drawings.pdf){target=\_blank}

The work done by **Reingold and Tilford** provides a relatively simple way to approach a complex problem: how do you beautifully render arbitrarily large trees? They provide an algorithm that does just that, enforcing several aesthetic rules on the trees it outputs. Mathy implements the algorithm to measure its trees for layout.

## Open Source

Mathy's scope is broad, and a few critical contributions from Open Source Software deserve special recognition.

### [Fragile](https://github.com/FragileTech/fragile){target=\_blank}

Fragile implements a swarm planning algorithm Mathy uses to solve problems without a trained model. It can solve most built-in Mathy environments on a desktop computer without a GPU.

### [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=\_blank}

The material theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=\_blank} makes creating beautiful documentation sites with mobile navigation and search as easy as writing some markdown files in a folder. Mathy uses this theme for its documentation site.

### [Silverlight Graphing Calculator](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight-Graphing-fb30536e/){target=\_blank}

When I began researching how to transform strings into expression trees, I came across a graphing calculator written in C#. The original parser and tokenizer came from Bob Brown at Microsoft, and Mathy still uses a modified version of this system. The clear and concise tokenizer/parser implementation has been endlessly helpful in porting Mathy to various languages.
