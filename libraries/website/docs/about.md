## Research

A lot of research has informed the design of Mathy's machine learning model and agents.

It's because of the insights from this research that Mathy works at all today.

In fact, Mathy's models perform well-enough to solve some types of problems reliably!

That said, I'm not a machine learning researcher and it's entirely possible that I've messed up on implementing some of the research listed below.

My apologies in advance to any of the authors if I've mangled your work in my implementation.

If that's the case, maybe you can [contribute a fix](https://github.com/justindujardin/mathy/){target=\_blank}?

### [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783){target=\_blank}

The work done by **Mnih et al.** in "Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning" describes a CPU-friendly RL algorithm that can be trained for some tasks very rapidly. The `a3c` agent is based on this [tensorflow 2.0 implementation of A3C](https://medium.com/tensorflow/deep-reinforcement-learning-playing-cartpole-through-asynchronous-advantage-actor-critic-a3c-7eab2eea5296){target=\_blank}.

### [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go){target=\_blank}

The work done by **[Silver et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf){target=\_blank}** demonstrated the power of taking a principled approach to solving previously intractable problems. It inspired Mathy to use Neural Networks and reinforcement learning to pick combinations of rules to transform the tree with. This work lead directly to the removal of a layer of "composite" rules in Mathy for combining like terms and simplifying expressions.

### [Tidier Trees](https://reingold.co/tidier-drawings.pdf){target=\_blank}

The work done by **Reingold and Tilford** provides a relatively simple way to approach a difficult problem: how do you render arbitrarily large trees in a beautiful way? They provide an algorithm that does just that, enforcing a number of aesthetic rules on the trees it outputs. Mathy uses an implementation of this work to measure its trees for rendering.

### [UNREAL](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/reinforcement-learning-unsupervised-auxiliary-tasks){target=\_blank}

The work done by **[Jaderberg et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05397.pdf){target=\_blank}** explores the use of unsupervised auxiliary tasks to encourage RL agents to converge at a much quicker rate than they otherwise would. They find that using shared network weights to predict different things can help agents learned shared representations that both can benefit from. Mathy uses an auxiliary task for controlling the grouping of like terms in an expression, inspired by this work.

## Open Source

The scope of Mathy is large, and there are a few key contributions that have come from Open Source software that deserve special recognition.

### [AlphaZero General](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general){target=\_blank}

AlphaZero General is a mostly-faithful implementation of AlphaGo in python. A heavily modified version is used by the `zero` agent in mathy. While the code has changed quite a bit, you can continue see parts of AZG in the MathyEnv and MCTS classes.

??? warning "Missing Functionality"

        At one point during an aggressive refactor and simplification pass, I removed the self-play evaluation step from the `zero` agent's training loop. Later, I saw a comment from DeepMind (link?) about how self-play is critical to continual learning because it creates a competetive challenge that is never too hard or too easy.

        The code for self-play is relatively straight-forward and should be revived for optimal training. It basically breaks down as:

        1.  gather **n** episodes of training data
        2.  **train** the **neural network** with all of the accumulated knowledge
        3.  execute **trial** number of episodes where the **current agent** and the **newly trained agent** race to see who can complete the task first
        4.  if the **newly trained agent** wins more than **55%** of all the trial episodes
            - assign the **current agent** to be the **newly trained agent**
        5.  goto 1.

### [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){target=\_blank}

FastAPI has a magnificent documentation site, and Mathy uses its template to structure its own site. A key insight from FastAPI that has made this site possible is the inclusion of code snippets from the website as tests that are run automatically. This makes maintaining tens or hundreds of code examples as easy as maintaining tests from a test suite.

### [Fragile](https://github.com/FragileTech/fragile){target=\_blank}

Fragile implements a swarm planning aglorithm that Mathy uses to solve problems without a trained model. It is able to solve most of the built-in Mathy environments on a desktop computer without a GPU.

### [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=\_blank}

The material theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=\_blank} makes creating beautiful documentation sites with mobile navigation and search as easy as writing some markdown files in a folder. Mathy uses this theme for its documentation site.

### [Silverlight Graphing Calculator](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight-Graphing-fb30536e/){target=\_blank}

When I began researching how to transform text into expression trees I came across a graphing calculator written in C#. The original parser and tokenizer came from Bob Brown at Microsoft, and Mathy still uses a modified version of this system today. The clear and concise tokenizer/parser implementation have been endlessly helpful as Mathy has been ported to various languages.

### [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/){target=\_blank}

spaCy has been an awesome inspiration for Mathy. It served to demonstrate that you can make Machine Learning as accessible as a pip install. Mathy uses a model packaging and loading system based on the one from spaCy.

### [TRFL](https://github.com/deepmind/trfl){target=\_blank}

Writing RL algorithms is difficult. The math is tricky, and when you mess it up your algorithm doesn't usually fail, it just sucks. DeepMind provides Tensorflow operations for many advanced RL losses. Mathy uses an inlined (Tensorflow 2.0 compatible) TRFL library for computing Policy Value network losses.
